# ConsoleApp
We have used C# to build an ATM  application .
- [x] user can deposit money.
- [x] user can withdraw money.
- [x] user can check balance.

We have created list of objects containing user's firstname , lastname ,cardnumber ,pin number & balance . Application will enquire through the dataset and find the expected user using the given cardnumber & pin number.
This is a very basic level code for a atm console application.
